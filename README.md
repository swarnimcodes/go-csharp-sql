# SQL Integration Analyzer

This is a port of my python program that serves the same purpose. In my opinion, this one is better.

## Goal
- Take in a project with nested directories and many kinds of files
- Find and process only C# files
- Find count, line number of SPs & Tables mentioned in C# source code
- Generate an excel file

## TODO
- Make use of a config file in future
